# Milkweed with a Monarch Caterpillar
## Description
This is one of the first web pages I have created. This is intentionally simple with a focus on practice using GitHub to create a repository and push up the image and index.html file. For this activity I included basic html tags to format the page.
## Usage
This web page will showcase my growth by showing where I started.
## Roadmap

## License
I am not sure what to add here but my work is free to share.
